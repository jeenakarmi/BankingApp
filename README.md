# DateEvent-Reminder
DateEvent-Reminder is a simple Python class that allows users to store and retrieve events based on dates.

## Usage
1. **Storing Events**: Users can input a date (in the format YYYY-MM-DD) and events separated by commas. If events for the given date already exist, the new events will be added to the existing ones. If not, a new entry will be created for that date.

2. **Checking Events**: Users can input a date to retrieve the events associated with that date. If events exist for the provided date, they will be displayed; otherwise, a message indicating no events found will be shown.

3. **Viewing All Events**: Users can choose to view all stored events. Dates along with their corresponding events will be displayed.

4. **Quitting**: Users can exit the program by entering 'q'.

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Follow the prompts to store, check, or view events.
3. Enter 'q' to exit the program.
